# saccadic-media-player
We prototyped an electro-oculogram (EOG) controlled YouTube player. Rapid (saccadic) eye movements create measureable bio-potential and more extreme movements yield higher potential recordings. A data acquisition system (DAQ) was used to convert the analog EOG signals into digital samples uploaded in real time to MATLAB. Rewinding, pausing, playing and fast forwarding were programmed to be associated with -60, -20, +20 and +60 degree saccadic movements respectively. The user, attached to the EOG apparatus, could carry out all four operations on a YouTube video in real time by relying exclusively on directional eye movement.
